# Function Tips

# Always return something

# Return Consistently
#  -> If we assume that a valid result is as common as a failure, we choose a sentinel with the same type as the valid result but whose value is never valid.
#  -> If we can’t choose a proper sentinel or we’re assured that failures are rare, we let the function signal them by raising an exception.
# yield don't return
"""
  A generator is an object that, when asked, lazily produces one item at a time. From a caller’s perspective, 
  it looks like a function with internal memory that remembers where it stopped after returning the previous result 
  and resumes from the next line; seemingly impossible.
  
  Generator functions remember their internal state between calls and can produce long (possibly infinite) iterables on demand, one item at a time. The latter is important if we process large amounts of data but have limited memory.

# if our list is large, sort it in place with list.sort(). If our list is moderately sized or needs to preserve the original order, call sorted() and retrieve a sorted copy.
